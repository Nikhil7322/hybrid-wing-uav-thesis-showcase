## üß© Overview

This repository presents a **high-level summary and visual showcase** of my M.Tech thesis project, which focused on the **design, modeling, and control of a hybrid-wing electric UAV**. This repository contains the end-to-end design, modeling, and control tools developed for an electric hybrid-wing UAV that integrates an X-configuration quadrotor VTOL module onto a fixed-wing Aerosonde airframe. The project includes battery sizing, additional Aerodynamic Drag prediction, a combined 6-DoF Simulink model, and four transition control strategies. Key simulation results show a 20% reduction in altitude error during forward transition compared to baseline, stable cruise establishment within 13 s, and controlled backward transition with altitude error under 1.6 m. The work demonstrates that a physical design change, gain-scheduled cascaded PID architecture can produce smooth and reliable VTOL‚Üîcruise transitions with low implementation complexity.


The work involved:
- Full 6-DoF Simulink model combining quadrotor + fixed-wing dynamics.
- Structural and propulsion sizing using FlyEval.
- Four transition-control strategies implemented and compared (descriptions and code included).
- Cascaded PID controllers tuned for hover, transition, and cruise regimes.
- SIL validation pipeline and mission-profile simulations.
- Analysis scripts (MATLAB/Python) to reproduce plots, metrics, and animations.

**Note:**  
This repository is a **non-confidential summary** intended for public viewing.  
The complete thesis, detailed models, and code are not included due to institutional and IP restrictions.

##  ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Sizing & Configuration**
   - Use FlyEval to perform structural sizing.
   - Use **iterative optimization algorithm** for **Li-Po** battery sizing.
   - Select X-configuration quadrotor optimized for thrust, endurance, and reduced aerodynamic interference.


2. **Modeling:**  
   - Built independent 6-DoF models for quadrotor and fixed-wing in *Simulink*  
   - Combined them into a unified hybrid-wing UAV model  
   - Incorporated actuator dynamics, aerodynamic couplings, and thrust allocation

3. **Control Design**
   - Design cascaded PID controllers for hover, forward **&** backward transition, and cruise.
   - Implement four transition-control strategies:
     1. Dual-controller attitude sharing with thrust augmentation
     2. PID blending with fixed incidence
     3. Gain-scheduled PID (decoupled)
     4. Hybrid blending with feedforward compensation
   - Tuned using step-response analysis and Control System tuner application in MATLAB 

4. **Validation**
   - Execute waypoint-driven mission profiles in SIL.
   - Compare metrics: altitude error, time-to-cruise, transition stability, failure/crash rate.
   
5. **Analysis**
   - Quantitative results (metrics & plots).
   - Visual validation (flight path, Simulink scopes).
